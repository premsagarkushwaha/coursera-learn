    "\n",
    "## Preamble\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article we'll learn two of the most basic methods to implement Question Answering system.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Question Answering (QA) system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_answering) is an information retrieval system in which a direct answer is expected in response to a submitted query, rather than a set of references that may contain the answers. QAs aim at satisfying users who are looking to answer a specific question in natural language.\n",
    "QA system works like search engine, but with different result representation: search engine returns list of links to answering resources, while QA systeem gives direct answer to question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The information-retrieval process in QA system is broken down into 3 stages: question processing, ranking, and answer extraction. Question processing and ranking can be performed using algorithmic functions or with Machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "QA system with approximate match function is simple as: \n",
    "\n",
    "![](Question-Answer-approximate.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "More complex system uses NLP technique to understand natural language. [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) is the ability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken. Pipeline of QA system with pre-trained NLP model includes 2 stages, preparation of data and proceessing:\n",

    "To run theese examples, you need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/). Also install [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/install) and few Python modules:\n",

    "```bash\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For demo purposes, we use extremely small set of question-answer pairs in CSV file. To build high-quality QA system you should use a lot of question samples, specialized data storage or database for fast lookup, and, as you'll see at the end, its a good idea to master training of NLP models. In our examples we are going to use knowledge base as-is without any modification, but you are free to insert additional question samples to improve answering quality.\n",
